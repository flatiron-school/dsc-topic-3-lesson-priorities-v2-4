# 1st Priority

If you are short on time, be sure to make it through these items:
- File Input and Output in Python
- CSV
- JSON
- Data Serialization Formats - Cumulative Lab
> Note: If you can't yet see the cumulative lab, don't worry.  It may not be visible until a pair programming session led by your instructor.

# 2nd Priority
- JSON - Lab: 
>Good additional practice with key/value pairs, accessing a list by index values, and for loops.
- Working with Known JSON Schemas
- Working with Known JSON Schemas - Lab

## Appendix

Once you are familiar with file input/output in Python, CSV's, and JSONs, move on to the appendix.

In it you will find even another opportunity to practice JSON's in the **Exploring and Transforming JSON Schemas** lessons.  

You will also find a lab to practice building functions.  If you are uncomfortable with the syntax required to build a function, use the `Building a Calculator` lab to level up your skills. 

You will also find lessons that go into more detail about XML. XML is less important than JSON to the scope of the program, but important to know about for webscraping and general familiarity with common data structures.

# Note On Lesson Priorities
The items in the topics are meant to be completed sequentially. Lesson priorities are meant to help you zero in on the most important content if you are short on time. That does not mean the items marked as 2nd Priority are not important to your development as a data scientist. Rather, it means that they do not introduce concepts that are essential to progressing through the Flatiron Data Science program.

You will notice that many labs are marked 2nd Priority. Labs reinforce concepts which are introduced by prior items. If you are short on time, your first priority should be to digest the concept where it has been introduced, then reinforce the concept in the lab when you have time.
